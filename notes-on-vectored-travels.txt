first pass
probably would be good to make sure what I'm envisioning actually improves things

prototype might be easiest as a standalone gcode transformation script
configure slicer in such a way (verbose g-code, specific settings on retractions, moves, wipes, etc.)
that the transformation script can figure out where to transform

if I have PA dialed in, what happens if I change a travel into a vectored travel
with a terminal 'wiped' de-retraction that ends exactly as it reaches the start of the next
extrusion move, where the deretraction normally would occur?
